	<h4>A Prom Dress for Any Occasion.</h4>
	<p>
        For senior prom, I added individually programmable lights to my prom dress in order to create a dress that could 
        truly light up a room. This project had two parts: one was a sewable Adafruit Flora module attached to many different
        sewable LED lights, and another was a sewable Bluetooth Low Energy module. 

        At the end of the day, any color could be chosen to display from any phone via a bluetooth connection.
